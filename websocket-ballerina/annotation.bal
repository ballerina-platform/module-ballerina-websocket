# Configurations for a WebSocket service.
#
# + subProtocols - Negotiable sub protocol by the service
# + idleTimeout - Idle timeout for the client connection. Upon timeout, `onIdleTimeout` resource (if defined)
#                          in the server service will be triggered. Note that this overrides the `timeout` config
#                          in the `websocket:Listener` which is applicable only for the initial HTTP upgrade request.
# + maxFrameSize - The maximum payload size of a WebSocket frame in bytes.
#                  If this is not set or is negative or zero, the default frame size which is 65536 will be used.
